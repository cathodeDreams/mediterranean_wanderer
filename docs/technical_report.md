        -   Modified the `render` method to:
            -   Iterate through the `Island`'s terrain.
            -   Call `get_terrain_symbol` for each tile.
            -   Use `console.print` with the returned symbol and color to render the terrain.

## Current Status

-   **Core Structure:** The basic project structure is complete and stable.
-   **World Generation:** The `Island` class generates realistic terrain using Perlin noise. The terrain includes a circular island shape with varied heights and distinct biomes.
-   **Biome System:** Implemented a sophisticated biome system.
-   **Engine:** The `Engine` class handles initialization, rendering, event handling, and the main game loop.
-   **Rendering:** The terrain, biomes, discovered locations, and inventory are visualized correctly. Colors are dynamically adjusted based on the time of day and weather.
-   **Player Movement:** The player can move around the island. Movement is restricted by terrain and map boundaries.
-   **Time System:** A fully functional day/night cycle is implemented.
-   **Weather System:** A fully functional weather system with transitions is implemented.
-   **Discoverable Locations:** Locations are generated, discovered, and rendered.
-   **Interaction System:** Players can interact with locations to discover and examine them, and collect items.
-   **Message Log:** A message log system tracks and displays game events.
-   **Inventory System:** A basic inventory system is implemented, allowing players to collect, manage, and view items.
-   **Testing and Coverage:**
    - 124 tests passing in 1.60s
    - Overall coverage: 95% (816/855 statements)
    - Module coverage:
      - Perfect coverage (100%):
        - `__init__.py`
        - `items.py`
        - `message_log.py`

      - High coverage (95-99%):
        - `inventory.py`: 96%
        - `player.py`: 98%
        - `time_system.py`: 98%
        - `world.py`: 98%
        - `locations.py`: 95%
      - Needs improvement:
        - `engine.py`: 92%
        - `__main__.py`: 92%
        - `interaction.py`: 83%

    -   NPCs and villages (dialogue and interaction)
    -   Ancient ruins with historical snippets (content)
2.  **UI Improvements:**
    -   Improve inventory display.
3.  **Content Generation:**
    -   Design and implement NPC dialogue system
    -   Add more collectible items and location types.
4.  **Testing Improvements:**
    - Increase coverage of `interaction.py` (currently 83%)
    - Improve coverage of `engine.py` and `__main__.py`
    - Add integration tests for complex UI interactions
