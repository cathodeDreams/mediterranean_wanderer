# Context for Next Steps

## Summary of Previous Work (Implementing Inventory System)

The previous work focused on implementing a complete inventory system, including item creation, inventory management, player integration, and engine integration for display and item collection. This involved creating new modules (`items.py`, `inventory.py`), modifying existing ones (`player.py`, `engine.py`), and writing comprehensive tests for all new functionality.

## Key Features Implemented

-   **Item System:** Defined item types, item properties (stackability, details), and a factory for item creation.
-   **Inventory System:** Implemented inventory with capacity, adding/removing items (including stackable items), organizing items by category, and error handling (e.g., `InventoryFullError`).
-   **Player Integration:** Added an inventory to the `Player` class, handling inventory-related input ('i' key), and providing a method to add items to the player's inventory.
-   **Engine Integration:** Implemented inventory display (toggled with 'i'), item generation based on location type during interaction, and item collection. The inventory display shows items organized by category and includes item details.
-   **Testing:** Created extensive tests for all aspects of the inventory and item systems, including edge cases and error conditions.

## Test Results (pytest)

One test failed: `tests/test_inventory.py::test_get_item_categories`. The assertion `assert len(categories[ItemType.SHELL]) == 2` failed because the length was 1 instead of 2. This indicates an issue with how items are being categorized, likely related to stackable items.

## Type Errors (mypy)

Mypy reported 33 errors across 4 files:

-   `src/island_rl/items.py`: Several errors related to incompatible types and operations on `object`. This suggests issues with type hinting in the `ItemFactory.ITEMS` dictionary, where values are not properly typed.
-   `tests/test_items.py`: Missing return type annotations in several test functions. Also, errors related to iterating over and using operators on `object`.
-   `tests/test_inventory.py`: Missing return type annotations in several test functions.
-   `src/island_rl/player.py`: Missing return type annotation in `__post_init__`.

The most critical errors are in `src/island_rl/items.py`, as they indicate potential runtime issues. The missing return type annotations in the test files are less critical but should be addressed for code clarity and maintainability.

## Next Steps

1.  **Fix the failing test:** Investigate and fix the `test_get_item_categories` failure in `tests/test_inventory.py`. This likely involves debugging the `get_item_categories` method in `inventory.py` and how it handles stackable items.
2.  **Address mypy errors:**
    *   Fix the type errors in `src/island_rl/items.py` related to the `ItemFactory.ITEMS` dictionary. This will probably involve providing more specific type hints for the dictionary values.
    *   Add missing return type annotations to the test functions in `tests/test_items.py` and `tests/test_inventory.py`.
    *   Add the missing return type annotation to `__post_init__` in `src/island_rl/player.py`.
3. Consider the next feature to implement.
